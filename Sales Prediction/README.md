# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Sales prediction involves forecasting future sales based on various factors such as advertising expenditure across different platforms. In this project, machine learning techniques are used to predict product sales using historical advertising data.

The model helps businesses understand how advertising investments influence sales and supports data-driven decision-making to optimize marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze advertising data
- Predict sales using machine learning
- Identify the impact of TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisements
- Assist businesses in optimizing advertising costs

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **TV** – Advertising spend on TV
- **Radio** – Advertising spend on Radio
- **Newspaper** – Advertising spend on Newspaper
- **Sales** – Sales generated

Each row represents advertising expenditure and the corresponding sales value.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
- **Multiple Linear Regression**

This algorithm is used to model the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**
- **Accuracy (%)** calculated from R² score

Accuracy is calculated as:
Accuracy = R² Score × 100


---

## 📉 Visualization
- Line plot / Bar plot is used to compare **Actual Sales vs Predicted Sales**
- Correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships

---

## ✅ Result
The Multiple Linear Regression model showed good performance on the advertising dataset.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.91. 
This low MSE value indicates that the difference between actual and predicted sales is small.

R² Score: 0.89. 
This means that 89% of the variation in sales is explained by the advertising data.

Model Accuracy: 89%.

Accuracy is calculated using the R² score as:
Accuracy = R² × 100

These results demonstrate that the model predicts sales effectively based on advertising expenditure and is suitable for sales forecasting tasks.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
Sales prediction using machine learning provides valuable insights into advertising effectiveness. By leveraging regression models in Python, businesses can forecast sales accurately and make informed marketing decisions.
