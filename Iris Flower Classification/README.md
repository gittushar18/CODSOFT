# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project implements a supervised machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species using their sepal and petal measurements. The project is based on the well-known Iris dataset, commonly used for introductory classification tasks.

---

## Objective
- To understand supervised classification
- To train a machine learning model on real data
- To classify iris flowers into their respective species

---

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of **150 samples** with **four features**:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Target classes:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression (Multi-class Classification)

---

## Methodology
1. Load the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Apply feature scaling
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 100%

The high accuracy is due to the clear separation of classes in the Iris dataset.

---

## Conclusion
The model successfully classifies iris flowers into their respective species with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the basic workflow of a supervised machine learning classification task.
